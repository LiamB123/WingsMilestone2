Testing
Throughout the process i undertook indepth testing of the functions within the page
starting at basics i test all my links both locally and globally were linked usiing Chrome Developer tools which helped identify some problems early on, 
I had originally had java files linked in the wrong place causing a fault!
Quick reset of the workspace and careful arrangement fixed the problem reinforcing the importance of location when linking files.
Next as i began to build my script.js file, i would continue to run it through JSONLint. After realising it wasn't the script but the data that was the issue 
I ran the data through JSONLint and some typing errors were identified, saving me a lot of time combing through.
